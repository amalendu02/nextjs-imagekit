# Clip Edit â€“ Web-Based Video Editing Platform

## Project Explanation

Clip Edit is a full-stack video editing web application that allows users to apply real-time effects and media transformations directly in the browser.  
It eliminates the need for traditional, bulky desktop software and provides a lightweight, responsive platform for quick and efficient content editing.

---

## Problem Statement

Most video editing tools are either complex, resource-heavy, or locked behind desktop platforms.  
Clip Edit solves this by offering a fast, accessible, and browser-based solution where creators can edit and enhance video content without technical barriers or installations.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- Backend: Next.js API Routes, MongoDB (Atlas)  
- Authentication: NextAuth.js (Email-based OTP login)  
- Media Management: ImageKit (for AI-powered URL-based media transformations)  
- Deployment: Vercel

---

## Challenging Parts

- Implementing custom OTP login flows using NextAuth.js, along with route protection through middleware.  
- Efficiently handling dynamic image and video transformations using ImageKit on both frontend and backend.

- Designing a smooth registration/login UX while managing cloud media in real-time.  
- Integrating protected API routes with real-time effects in a scalable way.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add support for video trimming, cropping, and export features.  
- Enable user-uploaded video previews and editing history.

- Implement user roles and paid plans for premium features.  
- Add drag-and-drop timeline editing and real-time collaborative editing tools.

## Project Logic & Workflow

1. User lands on the homepage and registers via email.  
2. OTP is sent using NextAuth and verified to complete login.  

3. Once authenticated, the user is directed to a dashboard where they can upload media or apply transformations.  
4. ImageKit is used to handle all media operations through dynamic URL parameters, allowing real-time visual effects.  

5. Authenticated routes are protected via middleware, ensuring secure access to media and user data.  
6. The frontend communicates with backend APIs to manage user state, transformations, and storage.

## Additional Functionalities You Can Implement

- AI-powered automatic background removal or filters using ImageKit APIs.  
- Export edited video clips in different formats and resolutions.

- Integration with FFMPEG or cloud functions for advanced server-side video processing.  
- Real-time collaborative editing using WebSockets or Firebase.

## What I Learned

- Gained deep understanding of full-stack architecture with Next.js and API route design.  
- Learned how to securely implement OTP-based login using NextAuth.js and protect routes using middleware.

- Worked with ImageKit for dynamic media transformation and understood cloud-based media optimization.  
- Learned how to deploy scalable, production-ready applications using Vercel and MongoDB Atlas.
